    """A worker cannot see the gateway's secrets even without the static gate.

    Deliberately does not use the ``jq_pool`` fixture: ``start_jq_pool`` now warms
    the pool by forking a worker before returning, so the fork must happen *after*
    the canary variables are set, not before. Otherwise a worker forked by the
    fixture (before this test's ``monkeypatch.setenv`` calls) would never see the
    canaries in the first place, and the assertions below would pass even with
    ``_worker_init``'s ``os.environ.clear()`` removed entirely.

    ``shutdown_jq_pool`` runs first, before the canaries are set, because
    ``start_jq_pool`` returns early and reuses any pool already built under this
    PID. Earlier tests in this file — and ``tool_service`` tests that reach
    ``extract_using_jq`` in the default subprocess mode — can leave a live pool
    behind, and without the explicit teardown this test would silently assert
    against a worker forked before the canaries existed, passing even with
    ``_worker_init``'s ``os.environ.clear()`` removed entirely.

    ``run_jq_filter`` now re-asserts the static gate itself, which would refuse
    ``$ENV`` outright. The gate is stubbed out here on purpose: the point of
    this test is that the worker-side scrub holds *without* the gate, since the
    scrub is the backstop for anything the gate misses.

    Asserts absence of the parent's values rather than an exactly empty mapping.
    Under pytest the child reliably comes back with terminal-geometry variables
    (``LINES``, ``COLUMNS``) repopulated after the initializer runs, so an
    ``== [{}]`` assertion fails for reasons that have nothing to do with the
    security property. Verified separately: in a clean process the worker's
    ``$ENV`` is exactly ``{}`` and ``os.getenv`` of a seeded secret returns None.
